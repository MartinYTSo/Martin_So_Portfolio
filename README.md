# [Project 1: BC COVID Statistics](https://github.com/MartinYTSo/Beginner_BC_COVID_Project) 

This is my first project upon learning how to do data visualization from online resources such as YouTube and freecodecamp. For this project, I retrieved the the number of COVID cases in the Province of British Columbia, Canada from January 2020 to June 2020. I counted the number of people who were infected based on 9 age ranges:

* People who 10 and under
* People who are between the ages of 20-29
* People who are between the ages of 30-39
* People who are between the ages of 40-49
* People who are between the ages of 50-59
* People who are between the ages of 60-69
* People who are between the ages of 70-79
* People who are between the ages of 80-89
* People who are 90 years and older

Next, I made a new CSV file based on numbers counted and plotted the data based on the age range and the number of infections. This graph is helpful for those who are interested which age range has the most number of cases to this date.

Recently, I have updated this graph to the date of Feb 14, 2021
